## README

This dataset was created for a course at the iSchool at the University of Washington in the winter of 2022. It contains information about three of New York's Largest Public Library systems- New York City Public Library, Buffalo Public Library, and Albany Public Library. It is a breakdown of revenue, programming, and circulation in each library. The intended audience is researchers looking to commpare libraries and cost per library as well as New York State library users. It is freely available to the public.

The dataset is available in .csv format. There are no duplicate variables, and all fields have been filled. No cleaning should be necessary.
